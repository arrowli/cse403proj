* IonMonkey

IonMonkey is Firefox's JavaScript JIT. It "provides a brand new architecture that allows us to do just that. It essentially has three steps:

1. Translate JavaScript to an intermediate representation (IR).
2. Run various algorithms to optimize the IR.
3. Translate the final IR to machine code."
